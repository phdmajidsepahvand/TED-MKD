Structured Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation through Tucker-Guided Representation Alignment and Adaptive Feature Mapping

# 

### Overview

Structured Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation (MKD) is a novel framework designed to improve model compression and knowledge transfer from multiple teachers to a lightweight student model.



Unlike traditional single-teacher KD approaches, our method integrates Tucker decomposition with learnable convolutional regressors to achieve adaptive feature alignment. By factorizing high-dimensional teacher tensors into compact core representations, we enable semantically rich and structurally consistent supervision from multiple teachers.



We evaluate our framework on seven benchmark datasets â€” MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, Oxford-IIIT Pet, and Oxford-Flowers. The results demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art KD baselines, with notable gains on challenging datasets such as CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and Oxford-Flowers.



Our approach provides a robust, scalable, and efficient solution for multi-teacher knowledge distillation, making it suitable for both simple and fine-grained visual recognition tasks.
